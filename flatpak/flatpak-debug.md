# Debug Flatpak

**Host machine**
1.  `flatpak-builder --user --force-clean --state-dir=/tmp/flatpak-state /tmp/build-dir ./org.example.Factorial.json`
    
    This will build the programs

    --user -> this is take user installed runtime, provider (this is optional)

    --force-clean -> each time while running it will clear the artifact folder

    --state-dir=/tmp/flatpak-state -> This the place where it will download it's dependencies,..

    /tmp/build-dir -> This is the artifact folder, where builded binary will found

    ./org.example.Factorial.json -> this the manifest file


2.  `flatpak-builder --share=network  --run /tmp/build-dir/ ./org.example.Factorial.json bash`
    
    This will not build the program, instead this will use the already builded one and give with environment to run

    --share=network-> This is more important for debugging from host, because application will run in a flatpak (isolated container), --share=network will share the network between host and flatpak

    --run -> will run the command mentioned, here the command is `bash`, bash will start the bash shell

    /tmp/build-dir/ -> Already builded artifact

    ./org.example.Factorial.json -> this the manifest file

    bash -> this is the user command

    Now terminal is in flatpak container, the builded app is available in `/app/bin`

**Flatpack container**

3.  `gdbserver :12345 /app/bin/factorial` 

    ```
    [ðŸ“¦ org.Gnome.SDK flatpak]$ gdbserver :12345 /app/bin/factorial 
    Process /app/bin/factorial created; pid = 7
    Listening on port 12345
    ```

    gdbserver This will start the gdb server, with port `12345`
    This is wait until client connect

**Host machine**

4.  `gdb`

    Open a new terminal and start gdb client from host machine

5.  `(gdb) target remote :12345`
    
    This will connect with the flatpak container

6.  `(gdb) symbol-file /tmp/build-dir/files/lib/debug/bin/factorial.debug`

    This will attach the debug symbol

7.  `(gdb) dir /media/ssd/Project/revise/flatpak/src`

    This will set the folder for source path

8.  `(gdb) b main.c:factorial:8`

    This will place the breakpoint

9.  `(gdb) c`

    This will continue the program

**Install in host**
**Host**

Till now we haven't installed the app, now will install the app

10. `flatpak-builder --user --force-clean --state-dir=/tmp/flatpak-state --install /tmp/build-dir org.example.Factorial.json`

    --install This will install the Factorial in host application

11. `flatpak list`

    This will list the installed application from host

    ```sh
    jidesh@jidesh-MS-7E26:/media/ssd/Project/revise/flatpak$ flatpak list

    ```    
    

12. `flatpak run --devel --command=sh --filesystem=/media/ssd/Project/revise/flatpak --share=network org.example.Factorial`
    
    This will run the installed application

    run -> run the application, here the application is org.example.Factorial

    --devel -> run in developer mode

    --command=sh -> this execute the command in application flatpak conteiner

    --filesystem=/media/ssd/Project/revise/flatpak -> attach this file system to flatpak

    --share=network -> This will share the network with host machine

**Faltpak**

13. gdbserver :12345 /app/bin/factorial

    This will start the gdb server in flatpak, we can connect with gdb client from host

---

Below is failure method need more info
```

HOST
1. flatpak-builder --user --force-clean --state-dir=/tmp/flatpak-state /tmp/build-dir org.example.Factorial.json
2. flatpak-builder --share=network  --run /tmp/build-dir/ ./org.example.Factorial.json factorial
now you may see factorial output in the screen

HOST
3. sudo sysctl -w kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0
4. gdb -p <pid-of factorial>
4. file /tmp/build-dir/files/bin/factorial
5. symbol-file /tmp/build-dir/files/lib/debug/bin/factorial.debug 
7. set sysroot /var/lib/flatpak/runtime/org.gnome.Sdk/x86_64/48/active/files
