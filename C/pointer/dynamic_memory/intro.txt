Memory allocated during compile time is clled static memory.
These static memory are fixed cannot be increased or decreased during run time

The process of allocating memory at the time of execution is called dynamic memory allocation.
Heap is the segment of memory where dynamic memory allocation takes place

unlike stack where memory is allocated or deallocated in a defined order, 
heap is an area of memory where memory is allocated or deallocated without any order or randomly

dynamic memory allocation doesn't have an idea of what it is pointng to. so it will return (void *)
so user can type cast to necessary data type
