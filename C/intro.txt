# is preprocessor

file name end with .h is header file it will only include function declaration not definition

#include<stdio.h> means copy paste the file content of stdio.h to that line

copy paste is the job of preprocessor

Linker is going to map the functions from c standard library

1.type
    int
    float
    char
    const
    scope
    operator
    bitwise
    typecast
2.IO

    scanf
3. function
4. pointer
    intro

9. preprocessor

Memory segments of c

Text/code
    compiled code store (bin file). It is read only section. It is in lower section. 
    This section can be shared between multiple process. Process means any running program is called process 

Data
    It is divide into two
    * UnInitialized
            It contains global & staticvariables that are not initialized
            Life time is through out the program

    * Initialized
            It contains global & static variables that are explictly initialized
            Life time is through out the program
            Variable can be changed if non constant

Heap
    Dynamic memory

Stack
    auto, register, functions are store in stack
    life time until function execution

Environment
    env values and command line arguments
