# Learning by Contributing: GNOME System Monitor

This repository documents my journey of learning software development through real-world contribution to the [GNOME System Monitor](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-system-monitor) project.

I chose GNOME System Monitor because of its relative simplicity, clear code structure, and well-scoped UI, making it a great entry point into the GNOME ecosystem and open source development in general.

## Purpose

This project is not a fork or replacement for GNOME System Monitor.

Instead, it serves as a **learning journal**:
- To track my progress in understanding and contributing to a real-world C++/GTK application.
- To demonstrate a practical methodology for learning programming and open source contribution.
- To help others who want to follow a similar path.

## What I Knew Before

When I started:
- I had little to no experience with **GTK**.
- I wasn't fully comfortable with **C++**.
- I was unfamiliar with large-scale open source contribution workflows.

## My Approach

1. **Pick a Real Project**  
   I selected a simple and actively maintained open source application (GNOME System Monitor) to learn from.

2. **Learn on the Go**  
   I read code, broke it down, and looked things up as needed. I didn’t wait to “know everything” before contributing.

3. **Start Small**  
   My initial contributions focused on minor issues: fixing typos, improving comments, and understanding the build system.

4. **Document Everything**  
   This repository includes:
   - Summaries of concepts I learned (GTK widgets, C++ syntax, memory management)
   - Guides I followed
   - Challenges and how I solved them

5. **Stay Consistent**  
   Rather than rushing, I dedicated consistent, focused time to this process.
