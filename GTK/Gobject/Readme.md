It's essentially a framework that brings object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts—like inheritance, polymorphism, signals, and properties—to the C programming language, which doesn't have native support for OOP.

GObject is a C library that allows you to:

    * Create objects (similar to classes in C++).
    * Define inheritance and interfaces.
    * Use virtual methods and function overriding.
    * Define signals (a type of event system).
    * Define properties (object attributes with change notifications, etc.).

GObject
    The base type for all objects in the system (similar to Object in Java).
GType
    The runtime type system that allows dynamic type checking and casting.
Signals
    Like events or callbacks. An object can emit a signal (like "clicked"), and other functions can be connected to react to that.
Properties
    Key-value pairs that can be introspected and manipulated at runtime. Often used in UI frameworks like GTK.
GObjectClass
    The "class structure" associated with each GObject type. This holds function pointers (like virtual methods).

In GTK (which uses GObject), a button is a GtkButton, which is a subclass of GtkWidget, which is a subclass of GObject.
