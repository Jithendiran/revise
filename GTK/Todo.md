I'm new give a minimilistic program to understand the key concept

That's a **great approach** — learning by building small programs is the best way to **internalize GTK concepts**. Since you’re already exploring `.ui` files, `GAction`, and state handling, let’s organize everything you need to learn in **bite-sized steps**, with a **clear roadmap**.

## 🧭 GTK Concepts Learning Roadmap (For What You're Doing Now)

Here’s a prioritized list of **what to learn** — from basic to more advanced — **specifically targeted to actions, `.ui` files, state, GSettings, and signals**:

---

### 1. **GObject Signals** (`g_signal_connect`)

> The foundation for connecting events (like button clicks) to your own functions.

* Learn:

  * `g_signal_connect(widget, "clicked", G_CALLBACK(my_function), user_data);`
  * How to define a callback function
* Try:

  * A button that prints `"Clicked!"` when pressed

---

### 2. **.ui Files (GtkBuilder XML)**

> Define UI declaratively, then load it in your code.

* Learn:

  * Creating `.ui` files with Glade or manually
  * `gtk_builder_new_from_file()`
  * `gtk_builder_get_object()`
* Try:

  * Load a window with a button from `.ui`
  * Connect its `"clicked"` signal to a function

---

### 3. **GAction / GSimpleAction**

> Replaces manual signal connections for things like menu items, shortcuts, toggles.

* Learn:

  * How to define a `GSimpleAction`
  * Use `g_action_map_add_action()` or `add_action_entries`
  * `g_action_activate()` and `g_action_change_state()`
* Try:

  * Define a simple action `"do-something"` and activate it via code or menu

---

### 4. **GtkActionable Widgets + action-name**

> Bind a widget to an action using `action-name` in `.ui` or code.

* Learn:

  * `<property name="action-name">win.toggle-feature</property>`
  * What prefix `win.` or `app.` means
* Try:

  * A toggle button bound to a `GSimpleAction` with boolean state

---

### 5. **Keyboard Shortcuts with Actions**

> Allow keyboard to trigger the same actions as UI buttons

* Learn:

  * `gtk_application_set_accels_for_action()`
* Try:

  * Make Ctrl+D toggle something

---

### 6. **Stateful Actions (Toggle, Radio)**

> Actions that hold a value (ON/OFF or enum)

* Learn:

  * `g_simple_action_new_stateful(...)`
  * `change_state` callback
* Try:

  * A toggle action with a `GtkSwitch` in `.ui`

---

### 7. **GSettings Integration**

> Persist state across restarts

* Learn:

  * `g_settings_new(schema)`
  * `g_settings_get/set_value()`
  * Optional: `g_settings_bind()`
* Try:

  * Save the toggle state and restore on next launch

---

### 8. **GtkShortcutsWindow**

> Add keyboard shortcut help in a nice window

* Learn:

  * Define it in `.ui`
  * Use `<property name="action-name">win.show-help</property>`
* Try:

  * Press F1 to show the shortcut list

## 🧱 Suggested Learning Projects (Each 15–30 mins)

Here are **mini projects** to help solidify each concept:

| Project                               | Concepts                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 🔲 Button clicks that print messages  | GObject signals              |
| 📦 Load UI from `.ui` file            | GtkBuilder                   |
| 🎯 Menu item that triggers an action  | GSimpleAction + menu         |
| 🕹️ Switch bound to a stateful action | GAction + stateful toggle    |
| 🎹 Ctrl+D toggles a label             | Keyboard shortcut + action   |
| 💾 Toggle state saved to GSettings    | GSettings + stateful action  |
| ❓ Press F1 to show help window        | GtkShortcutsWindow + actions |

## Next Step for You

Start with a small program that:

* Loads a window from `.ui`
* Has a `GtkSwitch` with `action-name="win.toggle-stuff"`
* Binds it to a `GSimpleAction` (stateful)
* Logs when the action is toggled
* Adds a shortcut Ctrl+T to toggle it
* Saves/loads the value using `GSettings`

Let me know and I can scaffold this exact example for you — or guide you through building it step by step.
