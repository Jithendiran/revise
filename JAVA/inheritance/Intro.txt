Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent class.
Inherited class has the feature of their class and inheriting class
child/sub/derived/extended class is a class which inherite from other class
parent/super/base class is a class from where a subclass inherits the features

Inheritance is 3 types
 * Single
 * Multiple
 * Multilevel

example
 Single
   Assume A is a parent class B is child class. It is single level

 Multiple
   Assume A,B is a parent class C is a child class. It is Multiple

 Multilevel 
   Assume C class is inherit feature from B class. B is inherit from A class
   here A is Top level, C is Bottom level

Multiple Inheritance is not supported in JAVA


PolyMorphism
 poly - many
 morph - behaviour/form

 There are two types of polymorphism in Java: 
   * compile-time polymorphism also known as Static binding, Early binding (It is fixed in compile time)
   * runtime polymorphism also known as Dynamic binding, Late binding (Decision is taken based on run time)

  We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
  If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.


  overloading(compile-time) is explained in basic/Method.java
  overriding(runtime polymorphism) is explained in inheritance/Parent.java
  Run time polymorphism is done by Dynamic method dispathing
