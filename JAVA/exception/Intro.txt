Throwable class is used to handle all the exceptions

Throwable class is extended by Exception and Error

- Exception can be handled
     There are two kinds of exceptions in Java:

        * Checked exceptions: 
                These are the exceptions that are checked by the compiler at compile time. 
                If a method throws a checked exception, then the caller of the method must either handle the exception or declare it in the throws clause.

        * Unchecked exceptions: 
                These are the exceptions that are not checked by the compiler at compile time. They include runtime exceptions and errors.(eg: AirthmethicException, ArrayIndexOutOfBox,..)

- Error can't be handled
