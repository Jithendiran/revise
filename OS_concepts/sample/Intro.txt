Registers
    SI (Source Index) -> points to source array
    DI (Destination Index) -> points to destination array
    CS (code segment) -> points to currently executing base address of code or text segment
    IP (instruction pointer) -> points to offset address of current code segment
    
    CS:IP forms the current instruction address
    IP will increment to fetch next instruction
    DS (Data segment) -> points to currently executing process data segment
    ES (Extra segment)
    SS (Stack segment) -> has the base address of Stack
    SP (Stack pointer) -> it the offset address of Stack pointer
    SS:SP -> points to the top of the Stack
    Stack will grow down words which means SP will decrement when content is pushed
